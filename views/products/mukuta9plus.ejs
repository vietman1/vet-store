                    <p>Although it is a road scooter by nature, it is fitted with equipment allowing riders to venture out to easy terrain without worries. There are only a few <span>9-inch machines </span> on the market that combine a comparable variability of focus with modern and premium equipment features. This is the story of the new model Mukuta 9 Plus which, unlike the standard 9 version, <span>doubles the power to 1600 W</span>. It differs from the basic model by having two motors, off-road tires and eye-catching, gold-black finish. It also comes with torsion suspension, a number of safety features, as well as the ability to ride fast and over long distances. After all, <span></span> speak for themselves.</p>

                        <p>Despite having a wheel size that rather classifies it as an urban scooter, the <span>Mukuta 9 Plus</span> easily proves that it can do much more than that. How? Thanks to a duo of brushless motors providing a combined <span>output of 1600 W</span>. Which is why it conquers hills with an inclination of 25° without the slightest problem. After turning half the handle, like on a motorcycle, the Mukuta 9 Plus starts accelerating on a flat surface to its top speed of 48 km/h.</p>
                        
                        <p>The dual 48 V, 24 A controller of the Mukuta 9 Plus makes sure that you can leave the main road for dusty paths without having to worry about losing power. However, this power must be adequately supplied with energy, which is the task of the 48 V Li-ion LG battery providing a <span> capacity of 15.6 Ah and an energy of 835 Wh</span>. In normal conditions, the battery capacity lasts for 70 km long rides. The LG battery is unique by its easy-to-swap option. There is a handle right in the deck and, after releasing the holders, this battery can be easily removed and replaced with a fully charged one. Naturally, you can charge the battery in a standard manner via two ports located on the top of the deck and it takes <span>8.5 hours</span> to fully charge when using one charger or 4.5 hours with two chargers.</p>

                        The versatility of the Mukuta 9 Plus is mostly thanks to its <span>frame made of aviation-grade aluminum</span> that improves the scooter's stiffness and durability. The deck forms the largest part of the scooter body, being terminated by a raised rear section. As a proper scooter for all types of roads, the deck is sufficiently <span>wide and covered with an anti-skid mat</span>. The frame continues through the steering rod's neck towards the patented folding stem. It feels robust, which is why <span>you won't feel any swaying of the steering rod</span> even when riding off the road. To fold it, just loosen the single lever and attach the folded handlebars to the raised part of the deck.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The top of the steering column is dominated by <span>67.5 cm wide folding handlebars</span>. At their very center there is a <span>4.5-inch LCD panel</span> showing all riding data and graphically well-arranged setting options. To “start” the scooter, simply <span>place the NFC chip</span> close to the top of the display. Your left hand controls the motor switch, allowing you to ride in eco mode with a single active motor or use a <span>combined full power of both motors</span>. The uniqueness of the Mukuta 9 Plus is further underscored by its color design. The combination of black and golden color emphasises the fact that you are riding a truly extraordinary scooter.

                    <p>The Mukuta 9 Plus provides its new owners and riders with a truly comfortable and worry-free riding experience. It comes with <span> multiple equipment and design elements</span> that simply evoke this feeling. One of these elements is the torsion suspension at the front and the rear with <span>adjustable stiffness</span>. Along with 9-inch inflatable tubeless tires, they provide for an extremely comfortable ride at all times. Moreover, the tires come with an <span>off-road tread and enhanced puncture protection</span>. The brakes do not fall behind either, as in this case the manufacturer opted for a combination of an electronic and a <span>145 mm hydraulic brake</span> at the front and rear with a completely closed system for immediate response in all conditions.</p>
                    <p>The manufacturer also thought of <span>riding safety in poor visibility</span>, which is why the scooter comes with a front LED headlight, as well as <span>LED strips</span> on the sides of the deck serving not only as an ambient element but also as <span>turn signals</span> further enhancing not only your safety but the safety of other road users as well. The rear brake light completes the scooter’s lighting equipment.

Thanks to its <span>torsion suspension, tubeless tires with off-road tread and hydraulic brakes</span>, riding this scooter on any surface will be a genuine experience. The only downside in everyday use are the scooter's weight and dimensions. The <span>weight of 33.5 kg and dimensions of 126 x 54 x 21 cm (length, height, width)</span> after folding the scooter are not among the best values in this category. Therefore, carrying the scooter to the elevator or loading it into a car trunk will not be among your favorite activities.</p>
